	       <h2>2D Platform Game -- <a target="_blank"
	           href="https://github.com/BoomBanger/ProjectSquare">Github Repo</a></h2>
	       <p>This game was a project my friend and I developed during our senior
	           year of high school in 2022. The screenshots on the right show the UI
	           of the game. In the bottom left of the screenshots of the game, you
	           will see a blue square. This square is controllable by the player.
	           The goal of the game was to get the blue square all the way to the
	           top of the screen. However, the following obstacles are in the way:
	       </p>
	       <ul>
	           <li>Black Rectangles: The player can not pass through these. They act
	               as walls and platforms guiding the player. Some of these
	               platforms can move, either up and down, or left and right.</li>
	           <li>Red Rectangles: If the player touches these, they are sent back
	               to the start of the game. Conceptually, these act like lava and a
	               dangerous hazard that must be avoided.</li>
	           <li>Green Rectangles: These rectangles function similarly to the
	               black rectangles, except that they can disappear. They are set on
	               a timer to loop from an "appeared" state to a "disappeared"
	               state, and their color changes throughout this loop.</li>
	       </ul>
	       <p>While developing this game, I was in charge creating the user
	           interface of the game, the level structure, bounding the platforms,
	           and performance optimization.</p>

       <h2>Hyland Hackathon Submission -- <a target="_blank"
           href="https://github.com/BoomBanger/DungeonMastery">Github Repo</a>
       </h2>
       <p>This was a project my friend and I developed during a Hackathon hosted
           Hyland Software. This Hackathon had a 48-hr time limit, and took
           place in April, 2022. We created a map-creation software that
           was designed to be useful for D&D players, and other tabletop games.
           These are the following features of the software that I helped
           develop:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>The first picture on the right shows the start screen for the
               software. Since it is a map making software, the software makes
               grid based maps. The sliders at the front are used to determine
               the dimensions of the map that you would like to make. Clicking
               the button "Generate Blank Layout Map" takes us to the second
               picture.</li>
           <li>On this screen, the user clicks the black squares that form the
               grid for the map to create the "shape" of the map. Since this
               software was made with D&D in mind, these layouts are presumably
               used for dungeons. The map here is 5x5 because the sliders on the
               last screen were set to 5x5. Clicking the "Process User Drawn
               Map" button takes us to the third picture.</li>
           <li>Here, the user can adjust parameters of the map, like rounding
               the corners and making the walls more bumpy and rough. This is
               done through the use of sliders again. This is so the map can
               simulate cave walls instead of building, or create a more natural
               feel to the map. From here, the user can download the map, or
               they can continue to detail the map. This would take us to the
               fourth picture.</li>
           <li>In this fourth picture, the user can add the final touches to
               their map. They can add grid lines and scale the grid lines, they
               can add markers of doors, and they can add markers with numbers
               on them to signify places of note. Using the text box on the
               bottom of the screen, they can add descriptions of these markers
               for note taking purposes. They can then finalize everything by
               downloading the notes into a text file, and the map into a jpg or
               png file.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>If this software is interesting, you can take a closer look at the
           project at the Github repo. The software was compiled into the .exe
           file found on the repository.

       <h2>Personal Calculator -- <a target="_blank"
           href="https://github.com/Nick-V-W/Calculator">Github Repo</a></h2>
       <p>This calculator was the first project I ever developed. I worked on it
           alone in 2021. While it is not a finished calculator, it contains a
           couple of particularly convenient features. For example, the
           calculator offers dynamically changing buttons. This means that that
           the buttons can disable themselves if the current input in the
           calculator could pose a problem when processing. Take the input "78+".
           In "Image 1", you can see that all of the operation buttons are
           disabled. The calculator sees that the current input ends in an
           operation, and thus disables all operation buttons from being pressed
           to prevent two operation symbols being typed next to each other.
           Similarly, the decimal point can only be pressed if the current
           number does not already have a decimal point in it. This is shown in
           the second picture. Given that this is my oldest project, it is the
           least reflective of my current capabilities as a programmer, however,
           it still offers some insight into a couple of my skills: </p>
       <ul>
           <li>I have been working with GUIs and user based applications for
               several years now.</li>
           <li>I like to pursue useful features in programs I write. The dynamic
               buttons are an example of this.</li>
           <li>I am a motivated and hard-working individual. I wrote this
               program in the summer before I was a senior in high school, a
               long time before I received formal education in computer science.
           </li>
       </ul>
       <p>It should be noted that since creating this project, I have created
           another working calculator for one of my classes at OSU
           (CSE 2221 - Software 1) using Java. Details for the project can be
           found here: <a target="_blank" href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2221/web-sw1/assignments/projects/natural-number-calculator/natural-number-calculator.html">

            It uses a combination of HTML and CSS, with a little bit of Java as
